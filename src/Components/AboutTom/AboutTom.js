              The letters contained on this site letters were written by Thomas
              P. O’Connor during his time in the Army during World War II. The
              letters were saved by Catherine O’Connor and kept in a dark
              colored suitcase for many years. The suitcase was in the basement
              of the house we grow up in Brooklyn for approximately 40 years
              from the mid-1950s until 1993. During this time the suitcase was
              “off-limits,” it was known to contain letters but was never
              opened. The suitcase was moved to Maine in 1994 and kept in the
              basement of our house for about 28 years until 2021. The suitcase
              was opened in 2021 and found that it contained approximately 60
              letters. The letters span the period from 7/5/43 to 8/30/45.
              During the period when the letters were written, Dad / Grandpa was
              between 25 and 27 and Mom / Grandma was between 23 and 25 years
              old.

              I obtained a copy of his <a href="/images/dischargepaper.webp" target="_blank">Military Personnel File </a> and tracked the
              movement of his division using on-line web sites. He joined the
              army on June 16, 1941, and served until October 16, 1945. He was a
              member of the 44th Infantry Division, 71st Regiment which was
              initially comprised of men from the New York and New Jersey area.
              The Division was trained in Fort Lewis, Washington and then went
              to Louisiana and Kansas for predeployment training.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>The 44th division departed the United States via Boston
              and arrived by ship in France on September 15, 1944. The 44th
              Division marched across the width of France and entered Germany in
              late March of 1945. Dad / Grandpa was evacuated to Metz, France in
              April of 1945 to receive treatment for pneumonia and then returned
              to Germany. The Regiment was in Germany for approximately 33 days
              and then entered Austria for 4 days. The Division encountered
              enemy troops and was involved in numerous battles with German
              forces throughout this period. The total repotted battle
              casualties of the 44th Division was 5,655 which included 1,038 men
              killed in action.

              The Division returned to France and then the United States on the
              Queen Elizabeth cruise ship which entered New York harbor on July
              21st, 1945 with over 14,000 men. He was discharged from the Army
              on October 16, 1945, with the rank of Sergeant (Technician 4th
              Grade, discharge certificate is below). The letters dated from
              September 15, 1944 to May 4, 1945 were written while the army was
              in the field and were censored prior to delivery. The dates given
              in the text of the letters are different than the postmark dates
              on the envelopes. Dad / Grandpa almost never talked about the war
              or his service. He said he was in France, that he was involved in
              the Battle of the Bulge, and he came back to the United States on
              the Queen Elizabeth but besides that we knew almost nothing about
              his service.
