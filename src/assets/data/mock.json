      "text": "Dear Cathleen,<br></br>Received your letter and as always glad to hear from you. I also have to thank you for the very nice card, had ot laugh when I looked at it and dont think that its far from wrong. I see your in the big money now, $1.00 prize, boy that was a big doing. Did you day it was a ballroom contest or a ballroom dance?<br></br> Now to tell you fo the doings at Fort Lewis, this week I have it very easy. The company went out in the field and the poor boys have to sleep in pup tents, but not me, I stay right here in camp and sleep in a nice soft bed. In the four day sthe boys are out, i have about seven hours work, all I have to do is show movies to some new fellows. They are all {UNKNOWN} movies and they put you to sleep. Outside of that Im still working hard ( I guess).  I ran out of money last weekend so I have to be a good boy this weekend, and thats hard, but I think the rest will do me good. Still go to church (the right one), take a sun bath, and read. If i have time ill write more letters, i have about ten to answer, I have to answer Marys tonight, she sent me the pictures we took at the beach that sunday, they sure look good.<br></br> Its nice to have pictures to look at  now and then and think about what was going on at the time they were taken (am i getting soft?). I am glad to hear about my pal {UNKNOWN}, he dont write so often , the only time I hear of him is from mary, I guess that job keeps him busy. I never did get to see Dixie and guess i missed a good picture. There seems to be some {UNKNOWN} I tell you {UNKNOWN} , I guess that will hold you and your big town stuff. Did you say you only saw it three weeks ago? Ill bet you cant think of an answer. I should get a medal for shooting but you have to buy them yourself, and I need every penny i cant get, I could get a lot of other medals too, but you know how it is, I just dont like to show off ({UNKNWON}). <br></br> I guess ill have to sign off now, Im glad {UNKNOWN} your working so much, thats half the battle. Keep up the good work, the next one is only 12 months away. So long for now, write soon, be good, go to church, take care of your self, Amen.<br></br>Love,<br></br>Tom",
